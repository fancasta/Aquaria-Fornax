<h5>Motivation for the website</h5>
<p>XYZ Marketing Pte Ltd, a local marketing firm has faced a huge challenge when the pandemic striked and everyone is required to work from home. Due to the nature of the industry the firm is in, project collaboration and discussion plays a major part in employees’ everyday work routine. Ever since work from home started, the management have seen a decline in productivity and lower project quality production. They conducted a survey among the employees and discovered that “communication inefficiency” was a big factor of hindrance in their project, hence they approached us to create an online web application to ameliorate communication within the company.</p>

<p> Our team from Aquaria Fornax will adopt the SCRUM methodology to develop the project management software solution tailored to XYZ Marketing. This application is critical for XYZ Marketing as with the ongoing pandemic situation, they would not be sure when they will be allowed back in the office again. With the respective features mentioned earlier, we aim to dissolve the existing communication barrier within the establishment and increase productivity.
